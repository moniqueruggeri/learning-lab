# learning-lab
studies and tests 🧪

This repository gathers my studies, experiments, 
and practical exercises developed during classes, 
courses, and independent studies.

🎯 Objective:

- Consolidate fundamentals
- Test concepts in isolation
- Document technical learning

⚠️ Note: This repository **does not represent final projects**, 
but rather an environment for continuous learning.
